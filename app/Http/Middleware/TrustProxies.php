     * X-Forwarded-Proto and treated HTTPS traffic as plain HTTP — which made it
     * redirect to "correct" the scheme, and a redirect downgrades POST to GET.

     * "The GET method is not supported for this route. Supported methods: POST."

     * Cloudflare. If the origin IP is ever exposed directly, replace this with
     * Cloudflare's published IP ranges: https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/
